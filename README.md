# IEEE_EndOfLine
- Programmed a line-following robot using Arduino (C++) as a team.
- Robot uses three analogue sensors to detect the black line’s position, designed to follow the line smoothly.
- Arduino reads sensor values and adjusts motor speed and direction in real time.
- Can go forward, turn curves or sharp corners, and stop if it loses the line.
- Goal: keep the robot on the track and moving steadily.
